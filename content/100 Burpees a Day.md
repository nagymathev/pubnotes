title: 100 Burpees a Day
---
Recently I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ensdxFTLGk) by _Yellow Dude_ detailing what happens when you do 100 burpees every day for a month. With the fact in mind that I don't exercise much throughout my day-to-day life, it peaked my interest to try it out and challenge myself to do it at least for a month but preferably as long as I can. So from now on I will list my attempts here including the time it took and roughly how many rests I took.

PS: It's really _fucking_ hard and exhaustingâ€”at least for now as I just started. I was laying on the floor like a dead fish during rests with my lungs fully dead. Anyways, as I said previously, below this little foreword all I'll have is a table listing the days with the time it took me each day and the number of rests it took to complete 100 reps.


| Day   | Time     | Rests | Additional Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Day 1 | 41:49.75 | ~6-7  | I really wanted to beat the 40min mark, but don't fret, there's always a next day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Day 2 | 29:40.85 | ~7    | To my surprise I woke up with a sore lower back but after stretching a little, it helped a lot with it. As I finished today's session I was really surprised to see the results. Not only did I beat my previous goal, but managed to beat the next goal I was about to set for my self by a few seconds as I quickly stopped the watch after finishing. My shoulders were really sore by the end, but I pushed through it as I really wanted to beat my record. Let's see about beating the 25min mark the next day. |
| Day 3 | 27:35.15 | ~5    | Didn't manage do beat my next goal, but at least managed to beat my previous record. I can imagine improvements starting to become more and more marginal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Day 4 | 32:22.28 | ~7    | No improvements. Took more rest time today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Day 5 | 26:48.18 | ~8    | Experimented with more sets, less reps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
